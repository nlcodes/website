      <h3>Update_11: Scheme Lisp C utils</h3>
      <p>
        commit bbe7e4e3e2cd85bd53de21220f74ec7c90afa0cc<br>
        Sun Feb 2 23:58:58 2025 -0800<br>
        Create c utils for for scheme program; rewrite gambit include syntax for c libraries</p>
      <p>LOG: I have recently taken a great interest in the lisp programming language. I'm specifically interested in scheme lisp, more specifically gambit scheme. I love the clean straightfowrard syntax lisp provides, as well as its "free" nature. The language is extremely flexible and recursive which is unique, and I very much appreciate it. It seems like a powerful tool for scripting, as well as extending c's functionality beyond its scope; Which, justifies its value to me. While i'm not typically a fan of higher level abstraction, lisp appears as something rather special. That being said I am happy to add it to my toolkit for a higher level option when needed regarding scripting, prototyping, etc. In this update I have written a lisp utility for gambit programming. For those not aware, gambit takes lisp code and can compile directly to c. One may also write inline lisp in C using an interpreter. That being said, I have metaprogrammed gambit scheme here in this program to change its own include syntax. This simplifies the syntax in a way I enjoy. While this is a small program, I intend to dive deeper and write more utilities in lisp, which will benefit my workflow. The possibilities are endless!</p>

      <h3>Update_10: Oscilloscope SDA/3v3 readings</h3>
      <p>
        commit unavailable<br>
        Date: Wed Jan 28 2025
      </p>
      <p>LOG: I got my rigol dho804 oscilloscope! This device has been very fun to work with. After setting up the scope, I was able to obtain readings on sda data and 3v3 power. Just look at those beautiful waveforms! Now that I know the essentials of operating this machine, I was able to validate i2c protocol data transfer, and steady power flow to components. Even though I already knew i2c was working on my drivers, it's good to see it visualized on the waveform to reinforce there aren't any major issues. I'm sure this tool will come in handy with future projects/protocols.</p>

        commit b670cb869d204f70be8f0a5ebe2a7f4fa6d413e1<br>

        Create main hal file hal.h; write and include hal files for oled in hal.h; write oled driver files and include in oled hal files</p>
      <p>LOG: Organized driver code into hal code (hardware abstraction layer). Forked bare_metal_c into a new repository, which split the project in two. The original bare_metal_c now only includes programs intended to be flashed by themselves directly to mcu, and used to accomplish a small bare metal interaction. I then moved the drivers library to a repository "stm32_hal", and re wrote them to integrate into a larger hal system. The purpose of hal is to make it easy to include, and call upon, drivers through an abstraction layer. This allows for one include "hal.h", instead of targeted driver includes. It makes my driver code easy to use again in future projects, easy to call, and more modular. While I am not generally a fan of abstraction, this abstraction layer is useful to me for modularity, portability, and organization purpose; It is not overly complex, and provides a cohesive framework to manage my drivers.</p>

        Create screen_init program; add program to programs dir</p>
      <p>LOG: Finished work on screen_init program (handles both init and writing pixels to adafruit oled). This took a little while to complete, and is a big win. This is especially true because just before completing this program, I also finished implementing a button board reading program "button_board_init". This program take input from my 4x4 button matrix, reads it and flashes test led on my blackpill. Both of these programs have been added to my bare_metal_c programs collection. With both of these driver programs working well, I am well prepared to begin work on the mcu game logic for matrix_break. All required peripherals are now successfully initialized!</p>

        Create program to handle button board inputs which toggle on board led      </p>
      <p>LOG: Started prototyping with components including a breadboard, jumper wires, an swd programmer, my newly soldered STM32F411 blackpill board, and a button board. The goal of this session was to test my understanding of breadboard wiring and register level programming by writing a program which turns the led on board the blackpill ON while holding a button down and OFF when the button is released. This program was added to a collection of bare metal programs and drivers I have been working on within the directory "bare_metal_c". In my program "button_board_init" which I spoke of earlier, I included one of my drivers called "led_on_off" which allows me to manipulate the state of the blackpill's led depending on inputs with the button board. While writing this low level firmware I have also been learning some basic arm assembly code in the form of my startup.s files for my programs. After making programs which achieve some effect, I have been transposing many of them to driver code which I may then use later in my work.</p>

        Create SDL window; add game matrix border and block
      </p>
      <p>LOG: Started work on matrix_break. This program will be a block breaking/matching action puzzle game. It is an embedded systems project written largely in C, with minimal reliance on libraries, apis, etc. The end goal is to have it running on an STM32F microcontroller which is connected to various peripherals. I am currently starting work on this by prototyping the game in SDL2 on my desktop. After that I will port the logic to STM32 firmware. After prototyping the hardware, I intend create a final build of the project using a printed circuit board and enclosure. So far I have rendered an SDL window, game matrix border, and a test block.</p>
